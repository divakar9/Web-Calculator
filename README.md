# Web-Calculator
Web-Calculator(A small full-stack web application)
A small full-stack web application. The application allowed users to perform add, multiple, subtract
and divide operations on integers. Being a full-stack application, the application have two main components –
1. Front-end: A web based front-end that renders a calculator form in a browser. The front-end will collect user input, send user input to the backend, and render results returned from the backend in the browser. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to send a request to perform a calculation on two numbers.
2. Back-end: The backend will accept an HTTP request from the front-end, perform the request arithmetic operation (add, multiply, …) and return the result to the front-end. I made a web server using Python Flask to respond to the request and provide the result.
